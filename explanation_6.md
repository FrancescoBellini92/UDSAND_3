# TASK 6 EXPLANATION

This task required finding the minimun and maximum value in an array of unsorted integers, with a single traversal.

Regarding time complexity, it is O(n) as we have to traverse the array to check each value against te current minimun and maximum

Regarding space complexity, it is O(n)
