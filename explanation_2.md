# TASK 2 EXPLANATION

This task required finding a target number in a rotated sorted array of integers.

The main logic can be summarised in the following steps:
- find the index at which the array is rotated
- do a binary search on the two portions of the array

Time complexity is O(log n).
Space complexity is O(n)
